    <p>Similar to Assassins, each player is assigned a target. However, the randomization of targets is taken care of by the app and the organizer is allowed to participate without the stress or burden of administration. The violent connotation of the name Assassins is also replaced by the modern and more friendly direction of paparazzi, who kill by shooting targets with camera phones.</p>

    <p>I led the visual design for this project,  but I worked with a fantastic team for UX design, development, and business strategy - Thank you Haley Dobart, Lizzy Perold, Athif Wulandana, Ian Pierson, and Connor Lay!</p>

        <p><strong>The Style guide</strong> <br>
            I attempted different styles, with the final direction inspired by 50s magazine covers characteristically styled with black-and-white photos against bright primary colors and bold lines. We eventually decided to go with a color scheme that was more muted, bringing out the bold color in the illustrative icons.<br> </p>

        <p><strong>Research</strong> <br>
            From the beginning I started researching existing brands such as Emergen-C and and Airborne, which focused their graphics around the fruit flavor of the supplement, or introduced a new fun character to appeal to children. However, I wanted VitaCore to be appealing to both children and to the adults buying them. In this case, the packaging had to be fun and playful, but still retain a sense of quality and authenticity.<br> </p>
<p>Through motivational reminders and behavior changing games, children will have more incentive to take their vitamins and also be more aware of the health benefits behind their actions. Hands on experience and interaction can encourage learning. </p>

        <p><strong>Biomimicry Studies</strong> <br>
           I looked into biomimicry studies of the apple, as a fruit. Oftentimes, nature provides us the inspiration we need to create effective products and even more effective packaging. The apple itself has three layers – the endocarp, the mesocarp, and the outer epicarp. This ensures the protection of the seeds inside. </p>

        <p><strong>Sketching &amp; Brainstorming</strong> <br>
During Phase 1, I focused on a few key words and ideas: Learning, Health, Lifestyle, Mental Health, Physical Health, Prevention. </p>
        <p> During phase 2, I Expanded on the key words which led to the idea of centering the packaging around the saying, “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.’ An apple’s five key vitamins are Vitamins A, B,C,E, and K. The combination of these five provide highly beneficial health perks, all of which would help a growing child. Not only is the apple is known to improve neurological health, but apple imagery is also culturally associated with teachers and academia, especially in early schooling.</p>

        <div class="large-6 medium-6 columns"> 

        <p><strong>Mockups &amp; Prototypes</strong> <br>
I created a rough mockup of an apple slice with bristol board and tape. Through this iteration, and iterations after, I found out that the geometric shape that I had been pursuing in one of my sketches was ideal for the form. Instead of rounded cuteness, the sharp angular features retained the sophistication that was needed  but still exposed a slight playful nature in the color and overall building-block-like shape. I also tested a few other materials including fiber board and corrugated cardboard. The cardboard was not ideal for the formal structure, but did make an appearance as an accent in the final label.</p>
