<p> The story behind AimHigh is a personal one. At the beginning of every academic year, I've holed myself up in a coffee shop to try and visualize what an ideal year would look like. What were my priorities going to be? What did I want to accomplish? The idea was to pinpoint in writing exactly what I wanted as thoroughly as possible. The annual Evernote document covered anything from time management, to health, to friendships and relationships.</p>

<p id="pullout">While I did understand my goals, they were largely based on feelings and were not quantifiable.</p>
            <br> 

<p> I've been my own test subject for three years and It's helped me grow. I set out to make this an easier process not only for myself, but also as a way to share it with others.</p>

              <p><strong>Research</strong>
                <br>Since it takes 40 days to make or break a habit, Jerry Steinfield says that the secret to productivity is something called the chain calendar. if you place a red x on a calendar for every day that you complete your goals, seeing that x chain will persuade us not to break it. Seeing consistency will motivate us to keep going. Data visualization helps pull together a vast amount of information and simplify it to tell a story. I started looking into existing trackers such as FitBit, Reporter, and AprilZero to try and understand human motivation.

                <br>AimHigh went through a few different visual styles through the prototypes. However, the general aim of it being approachable and friendly stayed the same. I brainstomed for words that invoked the images of altitude (e.g. climbing, clouds, space, sky, flying) and began moodboarding. I really wanted to focus on desirability, making the tool colorful and fun and to use.
