    <p>Vitacore is a vitamin supplement designed around the old Welsh saying, “An apple a day keeps the doctor away’. An apple’s core vitamins are Vitamins A, B, C, E, and K. VitaCore not only provides nutrition for growing children, but also offers an engaging experience aimed towards developing better mental wellbeing.</p>
    <br>
    </div>

    <div class="large-6 Medium-6  columns">
    <p>The final design comes in six parts – the core and each of the five slices. The slices each hold one of the vitamins A, B, C, E, or K. By separating each slice into pieces holding only one of the five core vitamins, the act of taking vitamins can become a customizable experience.</p>

            <p id="pullout">Core Knowledge is a memory game in which two players can take turns trying to find matching pairs of facts about the health benefits of apples.</p>
    <br>          
    <p>Beyond being a collectable toy, Core Knowledge is educational. Gameplay will help children remember to take their vitamins. After reading the instructions on the back of the first card, this two player game “Core Knowledge” creates interaction between people, whether that is between the guardian and the child, or between kids amongst themselves. This mental association builds up over time so that children can continue to learn about the health benefits of vitamins as well as develop healthier habits.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Constant reminders pop up elsewhere on the packaging as well, such as within the flap of each vitamin slice.</p>

        <p><strong>Research</strong> <br>
            From the beginning I started researching existing brands such as Emergen-C and and Airborne, which focused their graphics around the fruit flavor of the supplement, or introduced a new fun character to appeal to children. However, I wanted VitaCore to be appealing to both children and to the adults buying them. In this case, the packaging had to be fun and playful, but still retain a sense of quality and authenticity.<br> </p>
<p>Through motivational reminders and behavior changing games, children will have more incentive to take their vitamins and also be more aware of the health benefits behind their actions. Hands on experience and interaction can encourage learning. </p>

        <p><strong>Biomimicry Studies</strong> <br>
           I looked into biomimicry studies of the apple, as a fruit. Oftentimes, nature provides us the inspiration we need to create effective products and even more effective packaging. The apple itself has three layers – the endocarp, the mesocarp, and the outer epicarp. This ensures the protection of the seeds inside. </p>

        <p><strong>Sketching &amp; Brainstorming</strong> <br>
During Phase 1, I focused on a few key words and ideas: Learning, Health, Lifestyle, Mental Health, Physical Health, Prevention. </p>
        <p> During phase 2, I Expanded on the key words which led to the idea of centering the packaging around the saying, “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.’ An apple’s five key vitamins are Vitamins A, B,C,E, and K. The combination of these five provide highly beneficial health perks, all of which would help a growing child. Not only is the apple is known to improve neurological health, but apple imagery is also culturally associated with teachers and academia, especially in early schooling.</p>

        <p><strong>Mockups &amp; Prototypes</strong> <br>
I created a rough mockup of an apple slice with bristol board and tape. Through this iteration, and iterations after, I found out that the geometric shape that I had been pursuing in one of my sketches was ideal for the form. Instead of rounded cuteness, the sharp angular features retained the sophistication that was needed  but still exposed a slight playful nature in the color and overall building-block-like shape. I also tested a few other materials including fiber board and corrugated cardboard. The cardboard was not ideal for the formal structure, but did make an appearance as an accent in the final label.</p>
